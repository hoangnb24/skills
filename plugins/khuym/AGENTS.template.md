<!-- KHUYM:START -->
# Khuym Workflow

Use `khuym:using-khuym` first in this repo unless you are resuming an already approved Khuym handoff.

## Startup

1. Read this file at session start and again after any context compaction.
2. If `.khuym/onboarding.json` is missing or outdated, stop and run `khuym:using-khuym` before continuing.
3. If `.khuym/HANDOFF.json` exists, do not auto-resume. Surface the saved state and wait for user confirmation.
4. If `history/learnings/critical-patterns.md` exists, read it before planning or execution work.

## Chain

```
khuym:using-khuym
  → khuym:exploring
  → khuym:planning
  → khuym:validating
  → khuym:swarming
  → khuym:executing
  → khuym:reviewing
  → khuym:compounding
```

## Critical Rules

1. Never execute without validating.
2. `CONTEXT.md` is the source of truth for locked decisions.
3. If context usage passes roughly 65%, write `.khuym/HANDOFF.json` and pause cleanly.
4. After compaction, re-read `AGENTS.md`, `.khuym/HANDOFF.json` if present, `.khuym/STATE.md`, and the active feature context before more work.
5. P1 review findings block merge.

## Working Files

```
.khuym/
  onboarding.json     ← onboarding state for the Khuym plugin
  STATE.md            ← current phase and focus
  HANDOFF.json        ← pause/resume artifact

history/<feature>/
  CONTEXT.md          ← locked decisions
  discovery.md        ← research findings
  approach.md         ← approach + risk map

history/learnings/
  critical-patterns.md

.beads/               ← bead/task files when beads are in use
.spikes/              ← spike outputs when validation requires them
```

## Codex Guardrails

- Repo-local `.codex/` files installed by Khuym are workflow guardrails, not optional decoration.
- Treat `compact_prompt` recovery instructions as mandatory.
- Use `bv` only with `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches the TUI and should be avoided in agent sessions.
- If the repo is only partially onboarded, stay in bootstrap/planning mode and surface what is missing before implementation.

## Session Finish

Before ending a substantial Khuym work chunk:

1. Update or close the active bead/task if one exists.
2. Leave `.khuym/STATE.md` and `.khuym/HANDOFF.json` consistent with the current pause/resume state.
3. Mention any remaining blockers, open questions, or next actions in the final response.
